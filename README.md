challenges:
i had a lot of challenges for this project and they are figuring out how to clear a console, how to use stack, how to use linked list, how to check if the user's input is not a string, how to fix my code because the variable have been initialized before,
and why i want to input a new task in the option 2 part
for how to use stack and linked list i use the website geeksforgeeks The other problems i asked chatgpt how to do it, turns out you can;t clear console in intellij, chatgpt gave the way to check if the user's input is not a string,
chatgpt also fixed my code by changing the variable into a new variable, and chatgpt told me that i must add an extra scanner.nextline(0 part after the scanner.int so that it can work
